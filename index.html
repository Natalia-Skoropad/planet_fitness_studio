                    How to stop doubting and start exercising regularly
                </h2>

                <p class="programs-section-text">
                    Thousands of people dream about having a nice body. They start doing sport, face challenges and quit
                    it
                    in a few weeks or even days. Why does it happen? The problem is that people often do too much
                    physical
                    activity when their body is not ready for this load. Without allowing any recovery time between
                    exercise
                    sessions, they get tired quickly and lose motivation. We believe that you should have a smooth start
                    and
                    focus on developing a habit of doing sport regularly. So, we offer you a few training programs for
                    beginners.

                    Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to start -
                    people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy, overweight and depressed, who ate tons
                    of
                    junk food to seize the stress, those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another
                    planet.
                    On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza was OK and jogging was
                    exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and completely changed my diet, I still
                    believe we WERE on different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.

                    bar and assistance of psychologists, and dietitians. I'm sure that nothing will work until you know
                    where you are and where you go. Possibly, you are now on the planet Fatness and want to escape it.
